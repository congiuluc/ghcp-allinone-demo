# üêç Python Flask - GitHub Copilot Code Completions Demo

Complete guide to demonstrate Copilot code completions in Python / Flask.

## üéØ Demo Overview

Demonstrate code completions for:
- Flask route queries
- List filtering with filter()
- Query parameters
- Database queries
- Spec-driven development

**Time needed:** 5-15 minutes

---

## üìã Setup & Prerequisites

### Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- pip package manager
- VS Code with GitHub Copilot extension
- Internet connection

### Verify Setup
```bash
python --version    # Should show 3.9+
pip --version       # Confirm pip available
```

### Install & Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py           # Runs on http://localhost:5000
```

## üé¨ Demo Scenarios

### ‚≠ê SCENARIO 1: Simple Filter (EASIEST - 1 min)

**File**: `routes/student_routes.py`  
**Method stub**: `get_active_students()`

**Demo:**
1. Type: `active_students = [s for s in students if`
2. Wait for grey suggestion
3. Copilot suggests: `s.get('active') == True]`
4. Press Tab

**What's impressive:**
- Python list comprehension
- Dictionary access pattern
- Boolean logic
- Naming conventions

**Talk about:**
> "Python list comprehensions are concise. Copilot knows the idiom. It also knows you're checking for True, not just truthy."

---

### ‚≠ê‚≠ê SCENARIO 2: Range Query (MEDIUM - 2 min)

**Method stub**: `get_students_by_gpa_range(min_gpa, max_gpa)`

**Type:**
```python
filtered = [s for s in students if s['gpa'] >= min_gpa and s['gpa'] <=
```

**Copilot suggests:**
```python
filtered = [s for s in students if s['gpa'] >= min_gpa and s['gpa'] <= max_gpa]
return jsonify(filtered)
```

**Impressive:**
- Parameter usage
- Multiple conditions
- Return type (jsonify for Flask)
- List comprehension syntax

---

### ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê SCENARIO 3: Text Search (ADVANCED - 2 min)

**Method stub**: `search_students(search_term)`

**Type:**
```python
term = search_term.lower()
results = [s for s in students if term in s['name'].lower() or
```

**Copilot suggests:**
- OR condition
- Search in email or other fields
- Case-insensitive handling
- Return with jsonify

**Complex because:**
- Case-insensitive logic
- Multiple field search
- Parameter normalization
- Flask integration

## üí° Best Practices

### 1. Clear Function Signatures
```python
# BAD - Missing context
def search(q):
    ...

# GOOD - Copilot knows what you're searching
def search_students(search_term):
    # Copilot now knows this is student search
    ...
```

### 2. Descriptive Variable Names
```python
# BAD
a = [s for s in st if s['g'] > 3.5]

# GOOD
high_performers = [s for s in students if s['gpa'] > 3.5]
```

### 3. Type Hints (if using Python 3.9+)
```python
from typing import List, Dict

def get_active_students() -> List[Dict]:
    # Copilot understands return type better
    active = [s for s in students if s['active']]
    return active
```

### 4. Docstrings Guide Copilot
```python
def get_students_by_gpa_range(min_gpa: float, max_gpa: float):
    """
    Find students with GPA between min and max values.
    Results are sorted by GPA in descending order.
    """
    # Now Copilot knows to:
    # 1. Filter by range
    # 2. Sort descending
```

---

## üìù Spec-Driven Example

### Demo: Create search from spec-first approach

**Step 1: Write the docstring spec**
```python
def get_students_by_department(department_name: str):
    """
    Get all active students from a specific department.
    Results include: name, email, gpa, enrollment_date.
    Sorted alphabetically by name.
    Only return students with gpa >= 3.0.
    """
    # Let Copilot implement based on spec
```

**Step 2: Start typing implementation**
```python
active_dept_students = [s for s in students if
```

**Copilot now knows from docstring:**
- Filter by department
- Filter by active status
- Filter by GPA >= 3.0
- Sort alphabetically
- Return specific fields

**Teaching point:**
> "Documentation isn't just for humans. Copilot reads docstrings to understand intent. Write the spec, then let it implement."

## üöÄ Full Demo Script (15 minutes)

### Opening (1 min)
> "Python has clean syntax. Copilot understands Python idioms well. Watch how it handles Flask queries and list comprehensions."

### Demo 1 - Simple Filter (2 min)
- Open student_routes.py
- Show first method stub
- Type list comprehension slowly
- "See how it knows dictionary access?"
- "Boolean check for active status"
- Tab to accept

### Demo 2 - Range Query (3 min)
- Show second example
- Type range conditions
- "Multiple AND conditions"

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Copilot not suggesting?
- Wait 1-2 seconds
- Type more context
- Check Copilot status bar
- Reload VS Code

### Import errors?
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

### Port 5000 already in use?
```bash
python app.py
# Or set different port:
export FLASK_PORT=5001
python app.py
```

### Grey text not visible?
- Increase font (Ctrl+Plus)
- Change theme
- Check color settings
