# GitHub Copilot Code Suggestions Demo

Demo repository for GitHub Copilot **code completions** (not chat mode) across 8 programming languages.

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Type code slowly** in editor
2. **Copilot suggests** (grey text appears)
3. **Press Tab** to accept
4. **Press Ctrl+K** to see next suggestions
5. **Test the code** - it compiles and runs!

## 📂 Choose Your Language

| Language | Framework | Folder | Setup |
|----------|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Java** | Spring Boot | `java/` | Read `java/README.md` |
| **.NET** | ASP.NET Core | `dotnet/` | Read `dotnet/README.md` |
| **Python** | Flask | `python/` | Read `python/README.md` |
| **TypeScript** | Express | `typescript/` | Read `typescript/README.md` |
| **React** | React 18 | `react/` | Read `react/README.md` |
| **Angular** | Angular 17 | `angular/` | Read `angular/README.md` |
| **COBOL** | GnuCOBOL | `cobol/` | Read `cobol/README.md` |

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Choose a language and navigate to it
cd java  # or dotnet, python, typescript, react, angular, cobol

# 2. Read the setup instructions
# (See README.md in that folder for build/run commands)

# 3. Open VS Code
code .

# 4. Find files with DEMO TODO comments
# (These are where you'll type and see suggestions)

# 5. Start typing code slowly
# Watch grey suggestions appear → Press Tab to accept

# 6. Press Ctrl+K to see next edit suggestions
```

## 💡 What You'll Demo

Each language project has **method stubs with TODO comments** showing where to type:

```java
// DEMO TODO: Type the method implementation here
public List<User> getActiveUsers() {
    // Cursor goes here - start typing and Copilot suggests!
}
```

You'll demonstrate:
- ✅ Type code → See grey suggestion → Tab to accept
- ✅ Framework-specific patterns (Spring Boot, Flask, Angular, etc.)
- ✅ Next Edit suggestions (Ctrl+K) for what comes next
- ✅ Real code that compiles and runs

## 📋 Files in Each Folder

Each language folder contains:

```
README.md          ← Setup & build instructions for this language
src/               ← Source code with DEMO TODO comments
[config files]     ← Dependencies, build config, etc.
```

**Open the README.md in your chosen language folder first!**

## 🎬 Demo Tips

- **Type slowly** - Character by character so Copilot appears
- **Pause** - Wait 1-2 seconds after typing for suggestion to appear
- **Point** - Direct attention to the grey suggestion text
- **Tab** - Press Tab to accept and move on
- **Repeat** - Do 2-3 methods to show the pattern
- **Build** - Run the project to prove code works
- **Ctrl+K** - Show "Next Edit" menu for alternative suggestions

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Copilot not suggesting?**
- Verify Copilot installed: VS Code Extensions → "GitHub Copilot"
- Sign in with GitHub account (check status bar icon)
- Reload VS Code: Ctrl+Shift+P → "Reload Window"
- Wait 1-2 seconds after typing

**Can't see suggestions?**
- Increase font: Ctrl+Plus (several times)
- Use dark theme for contrast
- Try Settings → Theme

**Build fails?**
- Check prerequisites in that language's README.md
- Ensure correct versions installed (Java 21+, Python 3.10+, Node 18+, .NET 8+)
- Run the install/restore commands from the language's README.md

## 📚 Each Language README.md Contains

✅ Prerequisites & versions needed  
✅ Installation steps  
✅ Build commands  
✅ Run commands  
✅ API test examples (if applicable)  
✅ Troubleshooting  

## ✨ Key Features

- **Real code completions** - No chat mode, real autocomplete
- **Framework knowledge** - Each language's patterns built in
- **Next Edit** - Ctrl+K shows what to type next
- **Working code** - All examples compile and run
- **Multiple languages** - Same patterns across 8 languages
